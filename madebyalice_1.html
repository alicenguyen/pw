                    <p>                           Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
                on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had
                peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
                pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a
                book,' thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'  So she
                was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
                hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the
                pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of
                getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit
                with pink eyes ran close by her.

                There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice
                think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
                itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought
                it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have
                wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);
                but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its
                waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice
                started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
                never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
                watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran
                across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to
                see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
